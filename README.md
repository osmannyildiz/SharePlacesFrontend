This is the project from [Academind's awesome MERN Stack course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nodejs-express-mongodb-the-mern-fullstack-guide/). During the course, I learned how to build a fully-featured full stack app using Node.js, Express, React and MongoDB. This course helped me learn the MERN stack in a fun and efficient manner. I personally rate it 10/10, and recommend it to anyone who wants to get started with MERN stack from zero and learn by doing.

- [My course completion certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-00e3bd34-12ad-4afe-9733-49be96b896d7/)


After the course, I kept learning and applying my new skills to this project. Here is a summary:
- Moved from Create-React-App to Vite
- Integrated TypeScript and Sass
- Added new components and improved existing ones


#### TODO:

- [ ] Use TypeScript for backend as well
- [ ] Integrate a geocoding service; use real coordinates of the given address instead of random coordinates
- [ ] Group SCSS classes by prefixing them with a letter ("b" for block, "u" for utility, etc.)

Before releasing this project, I got permission from Academind via e-mail.

Special thanks to the tutors, Max and Manuel, for being a part of my growing journey and making this possible!
